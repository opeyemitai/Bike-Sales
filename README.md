# Bike-Sales
In this project a bike-buyers datasets was used, in which I grouped the age brackets of the bike buyers has Adolescent 0-30, Middle Age 31-54 and Old 55+. Made reports for Average income per purchase, Customer Commute and Customer

## INSIGHTS
From the dashboard, here are some valuable insights:
Gender: Men are more likely to purchase bikes compared to women. The average income of male purchasers is also higher than female purchasers.

Commute distances: The majority of bike purchasers commute between 0-1 miles, which indicates that bikes are mostly used for short distances.

Age brackets: The Middle-aged individuals purchased the highest number of bikes.

Average Income per Purchase: The gender with the average income per purchase is the male i.e they more likely to purchase bikes than the female.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
Few Recommendations:
Marketing efforts should be targeted toward men to increase sales and revenue.

Bikes should be promoted as a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective mode of transportation for short distances, and efforts could be focused on creating bike-friendly infrastructure to encourage more people to bike to work.

Target marketing strategies towards the Pacific region they had the least sales or emphasize on the health benefits and uses of bikes could help increase sales in that particular region.
